This is a work-in-progress second take effort for non native arithmetic and ecc constaints. Constraints rely on two simple arithmetic gates `A_0` and `A_1` both of which has 3 advice columns. These two gates can be shorted as `0 = A_0 + A_1` in the cases for conditional selection and composition operations which requires longer equation to satisfy and gates can be isolated as `0 = A_0 + alpha * A_1`  in order to accomadate simple operations such as addition, multiplication in a more dense way. Alongside of these gates generic number of lookup columns can be added to cover range constraints.
